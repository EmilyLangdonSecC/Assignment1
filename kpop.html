            <p class="top-text">I've always liked music, but it wasn't until middle school that I started actively
                listening to artists I
                like. It all started with a friend of mine who was into K-pop. She introduced me to these groups who I
                still
                listen to to this day!</p>

            <p class="kpop-text">This song is called <i>Lucifer</i>, by a group called <b>SHINee</b>. It's one of the
                first K-pop songs I remember
                listening to. To this day, <b>SHINee</b> is one of my favourite musical artists. Their style has evolved
                since
                Lucifer came out in 2010, but I enjoy their whole discography!

        <div class="flex-kpop">
            <p class="kpop-text">Though not my first, this will always be one of my favourite <b>BTS</b> songs. It's
                called
                <i>Spring Day</i>. I got into <b>BTS</b> roughly around the same time as <b>SHINee</b>, and while their
                music is very
                different, I love both groups. I even went to a <b>BTS</b> concert in 2018!

            <p class="kpop-text">In my humble opinion, this song is one of the most iconic K-pop songs in existence.
                It's called <i>Fantastic Baby</i>, by a group called <b>BigBang</b>. I can't remember what my first
                <b>BigBang</b> song was,
                but I know that I've loved their music since listening to it. This group was a pioneer in the K-pop
                industry.
