            <p class="home-text">This is a photo I took of one of my favourite power metal bands, <b>Battle Beast</b>. I
                attended a concert in August of 2023 where they supported another band called <b>Kamelot</b>. But how
                did I
                find myself in such a place? I haven't always been into metal; in fact, I haven't even always been an
                avid music listener.

                I decided to make this website about my musical journey. I will show you some of my favourite genres and
                artists as well as provide some semblance of a timeline for when I discovered them. Enjoy the good
                music!
